# Tennessee-Tech-Operating-Systems-Program
This is a project I was given during my senior year at Tennessee Tech University, in my Operating systems class. Over the course of the semester, I was tasked with adding more features to this fledgling OS.

Program 1 was simply creating the makefile, clearing the screen, and printing a simple message.

Program 2 was more complex, adding a process control block, queue and dequeue, and a process creator.

Program 3 was adding Round Robin scheduling, rather than First Come First Serve.

Program 4 was setting up a priority queue instead.

To compile, add the code as its own directory, navigate to said directory, and run "make all install run" in your terminal. 

Uses Qemu emulator to emulate the project, along with debugging with GDB.

This project only works on Linux Machines.

Boot1.asm was provided to me by my professor. The makefile, kernel.c and kernel.asm were all written by myself.
