# Tennessee-Tech-Operating-Systems-Program
The project I was tasked with creating for my Operating Systems course at Tennessee Tech University to create a basic OS.
To compile, add the code as its own directory, navigate to said directory, and run "make all install run". 
This project only works on Linux Machines
